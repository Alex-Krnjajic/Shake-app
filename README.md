 # Shake app

conists of two screens
first is a text input
second has a picture that will spin when the device is shaken and a textfield

Development

Had problems figuring out how to use the accelerometers until I caved and embarked on a quest to find the mythical indian dude on youtube
one google search later, I found it
same thing with the spin animation
well, the spin part of the animation was acquired from an Stackoverflow post about a endlessly rotating picture

I used the linear acceleration sensor to avoid having to deal with gravity
